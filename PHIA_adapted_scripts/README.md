Introduction

This repository contains the scripts used to develop an initial version of a Planetary Health Impact Assessment (PHIA) framework focusing on radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure from mobile telecommunication technologies. The project aims to explore both direct health effects of RF-EMF and indirect, ecologically mediated pathways that may influence human health. To support this, the repository includes code for extracting and visualizing interdisciplinary knowledge using knowledge graphs (KGs).

A central component of this work is the use of scripts (scripts no 2-13 and 15 and 18, the scripts for ontology population were not used) designed to automatically extract hypotheses and supporting evidence from published scientific literature and structure them into KGs. These scripts are adapted from the original code developed by Tabea Sonnenschein and collaborators, made available through her GitHub repository accompanying the publication:

Sonnenschein TS, de Wit GA, den Braver NR, Vermeulen RCH, Scheider S. Validating and constructing behavioral models for simulation and projection using automated knowledge extraction. Information Sciences. 2024;662(February):120232. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2024.120232

All adaptations were made to tailor the scripts for use within the specific context of this project, while preserving the underlying logic and methodology of the original work.
